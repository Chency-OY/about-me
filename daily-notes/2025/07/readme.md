### Last month, I decided to record life and upload then on github.
#### Not only to practice using english, but also to show what I do in one day.
#### My original idea was that a resume not able to show too much, such as efficiency in completing work.
#### However, after half a month's recording, I find it's hard to find some meaningful things I do everyday. Some days may just prepare for exam or to finish meanless assignments.
#### So, this month, I decide to record all of them and use different size of characters to distinguish them.
